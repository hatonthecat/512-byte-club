# 512-byte-club
A tilde~like club with no status updates with very plain pages for hosting contact info such as website, email, or other content

The point of this project isn't a replacement for larger clubs such as the https://10kbclub.com/, https://250kb.club/ nor 512KB or 1MB club, but rather to explore the purpose of ultra-light directories, similar to the Yellow Pages, but for the web. There are surely many sites where one can host more content, and surely this page/site could be complementary to that. But also, there could be new hardware that may allow the cost of hosting such a directory relatively inexpensive. One may want to host important contact info, but not need to purchase large server hardware. Even a Raspberry Pi may be more than enough for a basic server. Thus, the use of microcontrollers as servers could be an avenue worth exploring. This page does not make distinction as to the content of the server, although a directory-like listing is one idea. See http://buoy.hopto.org/ for another example.
