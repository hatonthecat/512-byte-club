# 512-byte-club
A tilde~like club with no status updates with very plain pages for hosting contact info such as website, email, or other content

The point of this project isn't a replacement for larger clubs such as the https://10kbclub.com/, https://250kb.club/ nor 512KB or 1MB club, but rather to explore the purpose of ultra-light directories, similar to the Yellow Pages, but for the web. There are surely many sites where one can host more content, and surely this page/site could be complementary to that. But also, there could be new hardware that may allow the cost of hosting such a directory relatively inexpensive. One may want to host important contact info, but not need to purchase large server hardware. Even a Raspberry Pi may be more than enough for a basic server. Thus, the use of microcontrollers as servers could be an avenue worth exploring. This page does not make distinction as to the content of the server, although a directory-like listing is one idea. See http://buoy.hopto.org/ for another example.

Other reasons for using 512 bytes have to do with packet sizes. I am exploring whether there is any advantage to limiting pages to packet sizes- in pwoer constrained memory controllers. For example, a microcontroller such as the Ambiq Micro Apollo3 does not use much power for the MCU, but bluetooth radios can use more data. To transmit over MQTT,

"MQTT Packet Sizes
The fixed header field consists of the control field, and the variable header contains the packet length field. The minimum size of a packet length field is 1 byte, which is for messages less than 127 bytes.

The maximum packet size is 256 MB. The minimum packet size is only 2 bytes with a single control field and a single packet length field. Smaller packets less than 127 bytes have a 1-byte packet length field. The Packets greater than 127 and less than 16383 use 2 bytes, and so on. 7-bits are used with the 8th bit is the continuation bit." 

Would there be any benefit to dividing an SMS-sized message into 1 or 2byte packets? What kind of useful info can be transmitted in less 10 bytes? A phone # number for example. Although it would not be very descriptive. a 16 byte message could be long enough for the receiver (if they know the sender) to call them. "555-555-5555call" is exactly 16 bytes, an extraordinarily informative message with an option to use alternative communication devices. Similarly, a URL shortener could achieve similar conciseness.

Thus the value in packet data transmission is less its size inasomuch its ability to conserve power, and could utilize battery-free microcontrollers which use very infrequent radio transmissions, enabling use of capacitors, as in this video: https://youtu.be/LDzxifG7VeA?t=636 A personal website may be simple enough to host an access point in a wireless network such as a apartment building. However for more frequent access, a microcontroller hosting a server for multiple concurrent connections such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaws_(web_server) (in the above 4000+ range would be untenable, even for 16 byte packet access, unless the server is able to transmit at 5Ghz speeds (not likely for a microcontroller). But there is utility in hosting tiny packet sizes, to allow hundreds of concurrent connections even on a microcontroller, which is typically used for a handful of bi-directional queues in very constrained and remote locations, such as oil pipelines.
